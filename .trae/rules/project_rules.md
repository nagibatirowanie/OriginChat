1. Always run the ./gradlew compileJava command after making edits to the code to check for errors, if errors are found, fix the errors and immediately run the command again to check for errors.
2. When fixing bugs do not try to fix the result of the bug, that is, to put crutches on the bug or just cover the bug it must be fixed completely that- to not have it
3. Always check before writing a new method that there is no similar method, avoid duplication of class methods and functions. 
4. Always use the most up-to-date library methods 
5. Avoid using outdated methods especially bukkit/spigot methods better use paper
6. Always keep an eye on the optimisation you can't have too much memory leakage, too much CPU usage or any other things that affect the optimisation 
7. Always notify the user after editing the code what kind of code you have fixed in what way
8. Always write only necessary comments in English, even if the user's request was in another language.
9. Always add javadoc markings to public used function comments
10. Always check the documentation of libraries before using them if the user has provided the following in context 
11. Always ask the user questions before writing code, it is better to ask several times and write the code as much as possible as the user needs it than to write it at once, but not correctly
